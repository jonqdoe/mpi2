##################################
frame_frequency saves: store grid data in logarithmicly spaced 
files. Will double the time between saves every time data
is written. 

send_buff: There's a skin layer where particles must be send to neighboring
processors as ghost particles as part of the parallelization. This determines
the size of that buffer. It should be longer than any expected bond length
or dx * pme_order, whichever is greater.

semiflex:
flag turns on semiflexible b-blocks of the diblock. These use bonds with 
finite equilibrium length (bond_eq), larger bond spring constant (bond_k)
and an angle potential between three adjacent B monomers of the form:
U_ang(\theta) = \lambda * ( 1 - cos(\theta_ijk) )

init_flag:
0 = random
1 = interface simulation. C homopolymers in half of hte box, A homopolymers
in the other half, and any diblocks are placed at the midpoint of the box.
